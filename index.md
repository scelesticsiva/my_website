## Welcome to my page on machine learning and deep learning

This will be the place where I will be including all that I learn about machine learning and deep learning. Humans have an innate desire to replicate themselves and machine learning is a result of one such endeavour to replicate the most complex organ in all of us, our brain. Machine learning has fascinated me so much that I think I am in an era similar to the "Computer" era which SteveJobs and BillGates lived through. Machine learning is no doubt going to seep into each and everything that we do everyday, it is just a matter of time before it happens. I do not want to miss this golden oppotunity to contribute as much I can to the machine learning community as it is in its rapid growth pace. As I do, I would spread the knowledge I gain to others through this blog.
