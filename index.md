## Welcome to my page on machine learning and deep learning

This will be the place where I will be including all that I learn about machine learning and deep learning. Humans have an innate desire to replicate themselves and machine learning is a result of one such endeavour to replicate the most complex organ in all of us, our brain. Machine learning has fascinated me so much that I think I am in an era similar to the "Computer" era which SteveJobs and BillGates lived through. Machine learning is no doubt going to seep into each and everything that we do everyday, it is just a matter of time before it happens. I do not want to miss this golden oppotunity to contribute as much I can to the machine learning community as it is in its rapid growth pace. As I do, I would spread the knowledge I gain to others through this blog. I want to kick start my blogging by stating some of the quotes that keeps me motivated.

##### From SteveJobs
```markdown
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything â€” all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart
```
##### From ElonMusk
```markdown
No, I don't ever give up. I'd have to be dead or completely incapcitated.
```

##### From EricThomas
```markdown
Pain is temporary. It may last for a minute, or an hour or a day, or even a year. But eventually, it will subside. And something else take its place. If I quit, however, it will last forever
```
